/*
 * To review, let’s try building some of the bank account functionality we talked about throughout the lesson.

First, create a new double variable called updatedBalance, and store balance with amountToWithdraw subtracted from it.
Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.

Now, you’ve decided to split your balance evenly 3 ways and give it to your three best friends.

Create a double variable called amountForEachFriend that holds your updated balance divided by 3.
Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.

Your friends each want to buy a concert ticket with the money you’ve given them. The tickets cost 250!

Create a boolean called canPurchaseTicket and set it equal to whether or not amountForEachFriend is at least enough to purchase a concert ticket.

Then, use System.out.println() to print canPurchaseTicket.
Checkpoint 4 Passed
4.

How much money did you give your friends, anyway?

Use + and System.out.println() to print out:

I gave each friend <amountForEachFriend>...

with the value of amountForEachFriend where <amountForEachFriend> is.
